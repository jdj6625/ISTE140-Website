        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Jonathan Jacobs and I'm from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Granby,_Connecticut"
            >East Granby</a>, Connecticut. I'm the youngest of 4 siblings with 1 brother (Chris) and 2 sisters (Lizzy and Kat).
            I have two very crazy dogs named Frankie and Faith back home and <strong><s>they are both monsters</s></strong>
            I love them very much. I aspire to start my own company one day and I'm very driven in the field of software.
            I also love sports and compete in Track & Field and I'm currently excited to watch the Australian Open.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h3>Academy of Aerospace and Engineering</h3>
        <p>
            My High School was the Academy of Aerospace and Engineering. This was my first introduction to engineering
            and where I fell in love with problem solving.
        </p>

        <h3>Rochester Institute of Technology</h3>
        <p>
            I am currently in my 5th year of University at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) studying Computer Engineering.
            I've always loved working with computers but it was here that I fell in love with programming them. I've completed
            two Co-Op's at New Scale Technologies and Retiina working as a Software Engineer in Robotics and Automation. I've
            learned an incredible amount here at RIT and I'm always looking to further my programming knowledge (like I am right
            now LOL).
